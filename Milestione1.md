# Milestone 1

## Open questions:
* Which DBMS is most compatible for our platform? Considering the following: easiness, (simultaneous) multi-user use of database systems, possible graph vision, (not difficult) connection to python, javascript….
 Is at first easier to create mock data in and use Excel for database? 
* Do we create everything now according to the prototype or directly thinking further for the end product? Do we consider the database of the university?
* What deadline should be put for creating the database and (at least) design for the prototype?
